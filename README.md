## Model considered

GitHub Markdown doesn't parse equations, so here's a description of the underlying SIR model.

- The ordinary differential equation model considers:
  - Susceptible, S, with initial condition S(0)=990
  - Infected, I, with initial condition, I(0)=10
  - Recovered, R, with initial condition R(0)=10
  - Total population, N=S+I+R=1000
- Susceptible individuals make contacts with others at rate c (=10.0), with the probability of a contact with an infectious person being I/N.  With probability β (=0.05), an infected person will infect a susceptible given a contact.
- Infected individuals recover at a per-capita rate γ (=0.25).

## Types of model

The above process can be represented in different kinds of ways:

- [Ordinary differential equation using ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia/blob/master/markdown/ode_mtk/ode_mtk.md)
- [Stochastic differential equation using DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia/blob/master/markdown/sde/sde.md)
- [Stochastic differential equation using StochasticDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia/blob/master/markdown/sde_stochasticdiffeq/sde_stochasticdiffeq.md)
- [Function map](https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia/blob/master/markdown/function_map/function_map.md)
- [Stochastic Markov model](https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia/blob/master/markdown/markov/markov.md)

- [Jump process (Gillespie) using Gillespie.jl](https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia/blob/master/markdown/jump_process_gillespie/jump_process_gillespie.md)
- [Discrete event simulation using SimJulia](https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia/blob/master/markdown/des/des.md)
- [Agent-based model using base Julia](https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia/blob/master/markdown/abm_vector/abm_vector.md)
- [Agent-based model using Agents.jl](https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia/blob/master/markdown/abm/abm.md)

Note that the implementations and choice of parameters may be suboptimal, and are intended to illustrate more-or-less the same underlying biological process with different mathematical representations. Additional optimizations may be obtained e.g. by using `StaticArrays`.

I've also tried to transform parameterisations in discrete time as closely as possible to their continuous counterparts. Please see the great work by [Linda Allen](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~lallen/) for how these different representations compare.

## Types of output

Thanks to [`Weave.jl`](https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl), Julia Markdown files (in `tutorials/`) are converted into multiple formats.

## Running notebooks

```sh
git clone https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia
cd sir-julia
```

Then launch `julia` and run the following.

```julia
cd(@__DIR__)
import IJulia
IJulia.notebook(;dir="notebook")
```

## Adding new examples

To add an example, make a new subdirectory in the `tutorials` directory, and add a Julia Markdown (`.jmd`) document to it. Set the beginning to something like the following:

```md
# Agent-based model using Agents.jl
Simon Frost (@sdwfrost), 2020-04-27
```

Suggested sections:

- Introduction
- Libraries
- Utility functions
- Transitions
- Time domain
- Initial conditions
- Parameter values
- Random number seed
- Running the model
- Post-processing
- Plotting
- Benchmarking

In addition, an appendix that displays the machine on which the code is run, and the package details,{} can be added using the following code:

```julia
include(joinpath(@__DIR__,"tutorials","appendix.jl"))
appendix()
```

Change to the root directory of the repository and run the following from within Julia.

```julia
include("build.jl")
weave_all()
```

## Acknowledgements

Examples use the following libraries:

- The [`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl) ecosystem for many of the examples
- [`SimJulia`](https://github.com/BenLauwens/SimJulia.jl) for discrete event simulations
- [`Agents.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Agents.jl) for agent-based models
- [`Gillespie.jl`](https://github.com/sdwfrost/Gillespie.jl) for the Doob-Gillespie process

Parts of the code were taken from @ChrisRackauckas [`DiffEqTutorials`](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqTutorials.jl), which comes highly recommended.
